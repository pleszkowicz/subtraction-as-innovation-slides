# **Via Negativa**: <br> Subtraction as Innovation

### The Prevailing Mindset in Product Development

📈 **Common Approach**:

- more features
- new technologies
- latest algorithms
- AI integration

🔄 **Alternative Perspective**:

- The Negative Way or Via Negativa

### Via Negativa

- 📚 **Source**: Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s "Antifragile, Things that Gain from Disorder"
- 🎯 **Focuses on**:
    - ❌ Identifying Non-Essentials:
        - Recognizing features or elements that do not add value to the product.
    - ⚠️ Risk Avoidance:
        - Actively avoiding actions, features, or technologies that could introduce unnecessary complexity or potential
          failure points.
    - 🚫 Intentional Non-Action:
        - Choosing not to implement certain features or changes, especially when their benefits are unclear or
          outweighed by their potential drawbacks.
- 📈 **Taleb’s View**: Knowledge grows more by subtraction than by addition

### Basal Cost of Software

- 📊 **Components**:
    - 💸 The initial development cost of the feature
    - 🔄 Ongoing cost associated with the feature's existence
- 🧠 **Includes**:
    - 🤔 Team knowledge and maintenance of the feature
    - 📈 Impact on other feature developments

---

### The Initial Cost of a Feature

- 💰 **Definition**: Cost incurred during the initial development until customer use
- 🚀 **Process**: Includes multiple deployments and feedback adjustments

---

### The Basal Cost of a Feature

- 🕒 **After Initial Development**: Ongoing cost reducing team capacity for new developments
- 📉 **Nature of the Cost**: Existence of the feature in the product, no modifications or bug fixes
- 🧐 **Why It Happens**: Knowledge/code maintenance, compatibility, and new team member training

### Evolution of the Cost of a Feature

- 📈 **Basal Cost**: Generally constant throughout the feature's life
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Costs can skyrocket due to obsolescence or mandatory updates

---

### The Problem of Neglecting Basal Cost

- ❌ **Common Mistake**: Assuming no ongoing cost if the feature is unchanged
- 🏗️ **Misguided Metaphor**: Comparing software development to construction

---

### Non-Infinite Capacity

- 📉 **Reality**: Team capacity is finite and impacted by the accumulated Basal Cost
- 🚧 **Result**: Reduced capacity for innovation, leading to maintenance overload

### Conclusions and Principles for Efficiency

- 🎯 **Goals**:
    - 🛠️ Minimize Basal Cost
    - 🔄 Iterate functionality for minimal solutions
    - 💡 Strive for simplicity and avoid over-engineering
- ✂️ **Action**: Eliminate reduntant features without desired impact to reduce Basal Cost
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Monitor**: Continuously check for obsolescence to prevent cost spikes
- 🧠 **Remember**: "Simplicity --the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-- is essential."
